OVERVIEW

This is a library for using and manipulating dual quaternions. Dual quaternions
 are useful for describing rigid body movements using screw theory.

If you use this library please reference it.


USAGE

To install type:

$ make install

To make documentation (recommended) type:

$ make docs

Docs are located in the docs folder that will be created when you run make docs.
